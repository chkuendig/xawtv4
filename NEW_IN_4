Getting started and Overview about the changes in xawtv version 4.x
===================================================================


Changes/Status Overview
-----------------------

 New Features + Changes

   * MPEG software decoding, and based on that:
     - support for DVB cards, including Budget cards.
     - support for MPEG Encoder cards (ivtv).
   * reworked configuration framework.
   * switch over to gtk as X11 GUI toolkit.

 Dropped Features

   * Overlay without Xvideo extention.
   * Resolution switching for fullscreen.

 Obsolete (likely will be dropped)

   * motv application (gtk-ported xawtv will take over ;)

 work needed (i.e. broken/untested right now)

   * movie recording.
   * lirc support.
   * mixer device support.
   * documentation is outdated.
   * fbtv & ttv.


Build it
--------

 Important compile time dependencies:

   mpeg audio  -  mad (http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/).
   mpeg video  -  libmpeg2 (http://libmpeg2.sf.net/).
   teletext    -  libzvbi (http://zapping.sf.net).

 The usual "./configure && make" should work.  You can start the apps
 without "make install" from the directory they are build in,
 i.e. using "cd gtk; ./xawtv".  Note that xawtv will prefeare the
 installed plugins, so you should delete them or move them away in
 case you have some older 4.x version installed.  3.x plugins will NOT
 cause any trouble.


The new configuration framework
-------------------------------

 Most important user visible change is that there isn't a single
 ~/.xawtv configuration file any more.  Instead a bunch of files in the
 ~/tv/ directory used.  Internally the configuration framework is also
 used to store informations which can easily be preserved then by just
 dumping it to a config file.

 Here is a overview about the files in ~/.tv/:

    devices.$HOSTNAME	device configuration.
    options		global options.
    stations		Configured TV stations, with Hotkeys and
			other meta inforamtion.
    dvb-ts		DVB channels: The transport streams with
			tuning info.
    dvb-pr		DVB channels: The programs with the pids
			and transport stream IDs.
    vdr-channels	The imported /etc/vdr/channels.conf file
			dumped (for debug only).
    vdr-diseqc		The imported /etc/vdr/diseqc.conf file
			dumped (for debug only).


Hints for using analog TV
-------------------------

 The scantv utility will scan for channels and create ~/.tv/options
 and ~/.tv/stations config files.  Unlike the 3.x versions it will not
 just dump a fresh file to stdout, but will read the old config,
 update it and save it.  Means you can also use it to update the
 configuration without loosing all the configuration like hotkeys you
 did after the initial scan.

 xawtv + mtt should work as usual.


Hints for using digital TV aka DVB
----------------------------------

 The alexplore utility can be used to browse the available DVB
 Channels and do a DVB channel scan.  It will save all found channels
 to the ~/tv/dvb-ts and ~/tv/dvb-pr config files.  They will be
 available to xawtv then for creating a station list (~/.tv/stations)
 using xawtv's GUI.

 TV Stations listed in ~/.tv/stations can have references to both
 analog and digital tuning info btw.


Hints for using teletext
------------------------

 mtt also supports both analog and digital TV.  In DVB mode it just
 sits passively on the adapter and monitors the incoming data, putting
 the teletext streams available from the current transport stream into
 the station menu, i.e. you have to use some other utility to tune the
 frontend.  mtt will happily run in parallel to a TV application
 without disrupting it.


Hints for using pia
-------------------

 pia is a simple movie player.  It can playback mpeg streams and any
 movies recorded by xawtv and streamer.  It can playback audio files
 (wav, mp3) as well.  It also works without X11, not playing video
 then for obvious reasons ;) Usage: Just pass the movie file name as
 argument.

 pia also has a -dvb switch to put it into dvb playback mode.  This is
 intented mainly for trouble-shooting / debugging purposes.  The -dvb
 switch expects a station name as argument, and pia will lookup the
 station in /etc/vdr/channels.conf.


Enjoy,
